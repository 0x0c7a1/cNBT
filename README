cNBT is an NBT File (http://www.minecraft.net/docs/NBT.txt) parser that doesn't
depend on the horrible slowdown that is the JRE.

Currently implemented features:

 * Complete parsing of NBT files
 * Basic modifications (Add a tag to a compound, values to a list or byte array)
 * Pretty printing
 * Writing (possibly modified) NBT structures back to a file

TODO:

 * More dynamic tree manipulation, easier tag creation

It depends on libz for gzip decompressing (and compressing later).
