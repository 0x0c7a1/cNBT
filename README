cNBT is an NBT File (http://www.minecraft.net/docs/NBT.txt) parser that doesn't
depend on the horrible slowdown that is the JRE and sticks to the C principle of
not trying to prevent users to shoot their own feet.

Currently implemented features:

 * Complete parsing of NBT files
 * Basic tree-manipulation functions
 * Pretty printing with indentation
 * Writing (possibly modified) NBT structures back to a compressed file
 * Full error reporting and graceful recovery from corrupt files and trees.

It depends on libz for gzip decompressing and compressing, and either c99 or
gnu89 support. c89 is just way too restricting.
